# Task Tracker Systems

Welcome to Task-Tracker-Systems.
üëã

Check our [wiki](https://github.com/Task-Tracker-Systems/.github/wiki) for latest information.

## Overview

Task Tracker Systems provide users the possibility to track time spent on individual tasks manually.

The systems are in early stage of development.
Contributions and collaborators are welcome!
There are plenty of possibilities for you to realize *your* ideas.

The feature objectives are:

- A dedicated handheld device can be easily used to track times of different tasks.
- The records can be transferred to a desktop or mobile device for further processing.
- An app for desktop or mobile allows to comfortably manage tasks.
- Data is provided such that other systems may import it (for example issue trackers or accounting software).

The main repositories are:

- [Task-Tracker-App](https://github.com/Task-Tracker-Systems/Task-Tracker-App) for the desktop/mobile app
- [Task-Tracker-Device](https://github.com/Task-Tracker-Systems/Task-Tracker-Device) for the handheld device
